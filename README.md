**ComicPlex** is a sleek Python-powered tool that:


1. **Scans** your folders for `.cbz`, `.cbr`, `.pdf`, and other comic files.
2. **Parses** messy filenames into series, volume, issue, year.
3. **Enriches** issues with metadata from ComicVine â€” writer, artist, publisher, characters, arcs.
4. **Stores** your library in a local SQLite database.
5. **Builds smart reading views** by story arc, character, creator, or event using symlinks.


âœ¨ Think of it as **Plex for comics** â€” automatic, organized, and future-proof.


## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -e .
export COMICVINE_API_KEY=your_key_here
comicplex scan ~/Comics --db ./data/catalog.db
comicplex enrich --db ./data/catalog.db
comicplex tag --db ./data/catalog.db
comicplex build-views --db ./data/catalog.db --views-root ./ReadingViews
```


## Notes
- Filenames arenâ€™t consistent. Parser uses multiple heuristics + fuzzy matching.
- Windows: symlinks may require admin/developer mode.
- This is an MVP â€” extend the filename patterns and metadata mappers as needed.


## Roadmap
- [ ] Add character/team/event tagging from ComicVine
- [ ] Support `.comicinfo.xml` metadata inside CBZ
- [ ] Smarter story-arc view generation
- [ ] Web UI for browsing your library
- [ ] Dockerized deployment
